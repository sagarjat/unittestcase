					<h2>--- Wrapper ---</h2>
					<article class="text-size">
						<p>There is a natural tension between the provider of an interface and the user of an interface.
							Providers of third-party packages and frameworks strive for broad applicability so they
							can work in many environments and appeal to a wide audience. Users, on the other hand,
							want an interface that is focused on their particular needs. This tension can cause problems
							at the boundaries of our systems.
						</p>
						<p>
							Let’s look at <b>java.util.Map </b >as an example. As you can see by below given list,
							Map s have a very broad interface with plenty of capabilities. Certainly this power and ﬂexibility 
							is useful, but it can also be a liability. For instance, our application might build up a
							Map and pass it around. Our intention might be that none of the recipients of our Map delete
							anything in the map. But right there at the top of the list is the clear() method. Any user of
							the Map has the power to clear it.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li> clear() void – Map </li>
							<li> containsKey(Object key) boolean – Map </li>
							<li> containsValue(Object value) boolean – Map </li>
							<li> entrySet() Set – Map </li>
							<li> equals(Object o) boolean – Map </li>
							<li> get(Object key) Object – Map </li>
							<li> getClass() Class<? extends Object> – Object </li>
							<li> hashCode() int – Map </li>
							<li> isEmpty() boolean – Map </li>
							<li> keySet() Set – Map </li>
							<li> notify() void – Object </li>
						</ul>
						
					</article>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section data-anchor="Page 5">
				<div class="text">
					<article class="text-size">
						<ul>
							<li> notifyAll() void – Object </li>
							<li> put(Object key, Object value) Object – Map </li>
							<li> putAll(Map t) void – Map </li>
							<li> remove(Object key) Object – Map </li>
							<li> size() int – Map </li>
							<li> toString() String – Object </li>
							<li> values() Collection – Map </li>
							<li> wait() void – Object </li>
							<li> wait(long timeout) void – Object </li>
							<li> wait(long timeout, int nanos) void – Object </li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Now we will take one another example and try to fix with wrapper.
							<br>
							<br>
							If our application needs a Map of Sensor s, you might ﬁnd the sensors set up like this:
						</p>
						<p class="pre-back" >
							<code></code>Map sensors = new HashMap();</code>
						</p>
						<p>Then, when some other part of the code needs to access the sensor, you see this code:</p>
						<p class="pre-back" >
							<code></code>Sensor s = (Sensor)sensors.get(sensorId );</code>
						</p>
					</article>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section data-anchor="Page 6">
				<div class="text">
					<p class="text-size">We don’t just see it once, but over and over again throughout the code. The client of this
						code carries the responsibility of getting an Object from the Map and casting it to the right
						type. This works, but it’s not clean code. Also, this code does not tell its story as well as it
						could. The readability of this code can be greatly improved by using generics, as shown
						below:
					</p>
					<p class="pre-back" >
						<code>
							Map < Sensor> sensors = new HashMap< Sensor>();
							<br>
							...
							<br>
							Sensor s = sensors.get(sensorId );
						</code>
					</p>
					<p>However, this doesn’t solve the problem that Map<Sensor> provides more capability than we
						need or want.
					</p>
					<p class="text-size">
						Passing an instance of Map<Sensor> liberally around the system means that there will
							be a lot of places to ﬁx if the interface to Map ever changes. You might think such a change
							to be unlikely, but remember that it changed when generics support was added in Java 5.
							Indeed, we’ve seen systems that are inhibited from using generics because of the sheer
							magnitude of changes needed to make up for the liberal use of Maps.
					</p>
					<p class="text-size">
						A cleaner way to use Map might look like the following. No user of Sensors would care
						one bit if generics were used or not. That choice has become (and always should be) an
						implementation detail.
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section data-anchor="Page 7">
				<div class="text">
					<p class="pre-back">

							public class Sensors {
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private Map sensors = new HashMap();
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public Sensor getById(String id) {<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return (Sensor) sensors.get(id);<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
								<br><br>
								//snip
								<br>
							}
					</p>
					<p class="text-size">The interface at the boundary ( Map ) is hidden. It is able to evolve with very little impact on
						the rest of the application. The use of generics is no longer a big issue because the casting
						and type management is handled inside the Sensors class.
						<br><br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This interface is also tailored and constrained to meet the needs of the application. It
						results in code that is easier to understand and harder to misuse. The Sensors class can
						enforce design and business rules.
						<br><br>
						We are not suggesting that every use of Map be encapsulated in this form. Rather, we
						are advising you not to pass Map s (or any other interface at a boundary) around your
						system. If you use a boundary interface like Map , keep it inside the class, or close family
						of classes, where it is used. Avoid returning it from, or accepting it as an argument to,
						public APIs.

						Third-party code helps us get more functionality delivered in less time. Where do we start
						when we want to utilize some third-party package? It’s not our job to test the third-party
						code, but it may be in our best interest to write tests for the third-party code we use.
						Suppose it is not clear how to use our third-party library. We might spend a day or two
						(or more) reading the documentation and deciding how we are going to use it. Then we
						might write our code to use the third-party code and see whether it does what we think. We
						would not be surprised to ﬁnd ourselves bogged down in long debugging sessions trying to
						ﬁgure out whether the bugs we are experiencing are in our code or theirs.
						<br>
						<br>
						Learning the third-party code is hard. Integrating the third-party code is hard too.
						Doing both at the same time is doubly hard. What if we took a different approach? Instead
						of experimenting and trying out the new stuff in our production code, we could write some
						tests to explore our understanding of the third-party code. Jim Newkirk calls such tests
						learning tests.
						<br>
						<br>
						In learning tests we call the third-party API, as we expect to use it in our application.
						We’re essentially doing controlled experiments that check our understanding of that API.
						The tests focus on what we want out of the API.

						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						Next we will take one important example Learning log4j

					<h1> --- Learning log4j  ---</h1>
                    <p class="text-size">
						Let’s say we want to use the apache log4j package rather than our own custom-built logger. We download it and open the introductory documentation page. Without too much
						reading we write our ﬁrst test case, expecting it to write “hello” to the console.
					</p>
					<p class="pre-back">
						@Test><br>
						public void testLogCreate() {<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logger.info("hello");<br>
						}
					</p>
					<p class="text-size" style="margin: 0;">
						When we run it, the logger produces an error that tells us we need something called an
						Appender . After a little more reading we ﬁnd that there is a ConsoleAppender . So we create a
						ConsoleAppender and see whether we have unlocked the secrets of logging to the console.
					</p>
					<p class="pre-back">
						@Test<br>
						public void testLogAddAppender() {<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MyLogger");<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ConsoleAppender appender = new ConsoleAppender();<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logger.addAppender(appender);<br>

						This time we ﬁnd that the Appender has no output stream. Odd—it seems logical that it’d
						have one. After a little help from Google, we try the following:

								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logger.getRootLogger().removeAllAppenders();<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void basicLogger() {<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BasicConfigurator.configure();<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logger.info("basicLogger");<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@Test<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void addAppenderWithStream() {<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logger.addAppender(new ConsoleAppender(<br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new PatternLayout("%p %t %m%n"),<br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ConsoleAppender.SYSTEM_OUT));<br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logger.info("addAppenderWithStream");<br>
